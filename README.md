# TechAid ‚Äî Technology That Helps the Helpers
Welcome to TechAid ‚Äî an initiative by the Norwegian Red Cross to bring technologists together to build life-saving solutions for humanitarian work.

Have you ever felt that what you‚Äôre working on doesn‚Äôt really matter in the grand scheme of things?
So have we. That‚Äôs why we started TechAid.

At Red Cross Norway, we believe that technology can be a powerful tool in humanitarian efforts ‚Äî not just in Silicon Valley, but in disaster zones, refugee camps, and war-torn areas.
TechAid is your chance to use your skills for something that truly matters.

Whether you're a developer, designer, researcher, or just someone who wants to help ‚Äî you can make a difference.

## üöë Example Project: Offline Access to Critical Medical Knowledge in War Zones
Our international teams need access to medical handbooks and procedures in areas where internet is unreliable or unavailable. We‚Äôre building a solution using Kiwix to make this information available offline ‚Äî running on battery-powered local hotspots that non-technical staff can deploy easily. AI could help make this smarter.

We‚Äôre looking for people who want to contribute to projects like this.
This is not a job. No one gets paid. But we promise one thing: an incredibly good feeling.

### Details 

The Norwegian Red Cross is responsible for setting up the hospitals in Gaza. 
The International department contacted us about finding a solution for the Red Cross staff so that they have access to the handbook and procedures ofline. They need ths as they are operating in a war zone and the internet connection is not reliable. 

We have suggested a solution where we we compile the information into the open source tool https://kiwix.org/

The kiwix Tool puts all info into their app. What i would like to explore is if it is possible to use AI and fill it with the knowledge from the handbooks.
We could then create a Hotspot wifi where the red cross staff can connect to. 

The solution must be easy to set up so that it can be operated by non tech staff. It must also be possible to run on batteries. 

The information we want to make available offline is https://rodekors.service-now.com/drm the ‚ÄúDisaster Risk Management‚Äù handbook.
