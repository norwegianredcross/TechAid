# TechAid â€” Technology That Helps the Helpers
Welcome to TechAid â€” an initiative by the Norwegian Red Cross to bring technologists together to build life-saving solutions for humanitarian work.

Have you ever felt that what youâ€™re working on doesnâ€™t really matter in the grand scheme of things?
So have we. Thatâ€™s why we started TechAid.

At Red Cross Norway, we believe that technology can be a powerful tool in humanitarian efforts â€” not just in Silicon Valley, but in disaster zones, refugee camps, and war-torn areas.
TechAid is your chance to use your skills for something that truly matters.

Whether you're a developer, designer, researcher, or just someone who wants to help â€” you can make a difference.

## ðŸš‘ Example Project: Offline Access to Critical Medical Knowledge in War Zones
Our international teams need access to medical handbooks and procedures in areas where internet is unreliable or unavailable. Weâ€™re building a solution using Kiwix to make this information available offline â€” running on battery-powered local hotspots that non-technical staff can deploy easily. AI could help make this smarter.

Weâ€™re looking for people who want to contribute to projects like this.
This is not a job. No one gets paid. But we promise one thing: an incredibly good feeling.
